# 🤖 Cheeky Commit Bot

![Banner with the text "Cheeky Commit Bot"](/images/cheeky-banner.png)

A **totally legitimate commit bot** for GitHub that pushes once (_or as much as you want!_) a day, even when you're taking a nap or just staring into the void trying to figure out how are you going to afford a house in this economy. :trollface:

## 🔧 What Cheeky does:

**Cheeky** is a _tiny_ Bash script that:

- Appends the current date and time to a file (`records.txt`),
- Commits the change,
- And pushes it to your GitHub repo using SSH.

Set it up once and Cheeky takes care of your daily commit streak _like a charm_. 🍀

<sub>_Cheeky cannot be held responsible for any raised eyebrows by hiring managers during interviews or is intended to treat commit anxiety. Use responsibly._</sub>

## ⚙️ Quick Setup:

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/cheeky_commit_bot.git
cd cheeky_commit_bot
```

2. Make Cheeky executable:

```
chmod +x cheeky.sh
```

3. Add it to your crontab.
